            <h5>Imagination to me is exploring the possibility based on certain assumption or hypothesis of which 
              whether we are aware or not.
              Working with people who have over 10 different nationalities, I started to assume that advising 
              on language would help people. I noticed sometimes people say something offensive to another 
              without knowing they could say the same things in a nicer way. It seems to happend 
              many places these days as Erin Meyer wrote in her book, <a href="https://erinmeyer.com/books/the-culture-map/" target="_blank">
              The Culture Map</a>.This app is for such users to be aware their language and suggests alternative ways to say.
              This chatbot gives the user feedback on what the user is about to say. <br/>
              Another assumption I had was that it is beneficial to use <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/built-in-nlp/?locale=en_US" target="_blank">
                Facebook developer built in NLP</a>, because the number of cases collected to judge intention 
                behind the language is larger than I can collect individually, and because I guess this ML 
                classification training results in the API to dismantle the language into reasonable sentimental entity.<br/>
                In actual, I found people like the simplicity of this app desgin. The chatbot has actually a few suggestion patterns
                per each sentiment or langauge group. For example if the language include 'denial' chat bot returns one of 6 sentences
                I have set, including 'It may oversight about ---', 'It may assumed too much about ---.', and 'Let's talk about it again.'
                User liked the instance response to what they said with expected responses. So far, I heard from the users that it is 
                interesting to use, and received 'like's from people I've never met.<br/>
                Chatbot seems a familiar interface for many users. Although what it does as a system is same whether it is a box form or
                chatbot. Both are input data and returned data. The power here I imagine is the intuitive impresion that the user receives.

            <h5>Graduated from the art school with printing major,
              I was curious how new media, digital will affect our aesthetics. Like Letterpress printing changed the way for us 
              to inherit knowledge in the 15th century in Europe, and woodprinting did so in the 8th century in Japan, 
              internet has been changing our way to find knowledge. Like many designers have been fascinated 
              with the editorial design which is a way to give a shape to the thoughts, I'm curious how this onlin media affects on our way to 
              digest knowledge and how it would affect our perception. Accordingly, I had assumption before this project that digitally generated view affects on our fundamental 
              aesthetics and perception. I started this type drawing 
              experiment with <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a> to image how our perception and the role of designers/artist may 
              change in the future.<br/>
              During this project, I tried to translate my letter observation and aesthertics into the instructions, lines of codes.
              I thought the languages I use for printing and coding were somewhat very similar, because it was important for both media that
              we plan work concept and information hierarchy outside the execution process.
              <!--On the other hand, they are very different at the execution. For example, when we print something on the paper, 
              we consider layers, opacity, paper and tangible feeling. When I tried to code them, we focused combination of 
              grey scale HEX color code (or 256^3 HEX color code), saturation, angle, direction, time, and speed.--><br/>
              In 1970s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt" target="_blank"> Sol LeWitt</a> explored this concept 
              by giving instruction to the machine to execute his artwork. He said 'All of the planning and decisions are made beforehand 
              and the execution is a perfunctory affair.' In another word, anyone can execute his artwork based on the instruction.

              After taking <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning" target="_blank">Machine learning at coursera</a>
              with curiosity to this technology, I started this project about font distance. During the project research, I came across

                Human-Centered Machine Learning by Google Design</a>, and more. Those material helped me to think further to decide 
                project design and I could share these learning at UX Talk Tokyo. This presentation slide is stored in

              Like Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, or Surrealism artist explored unconsicousness early 20th century, we
              sould not think we can examine every assumption logically. Personally, when I imagine something far away 
              from me in physical distance, time, some something larger than me, such as nature, I often find things differently.
              In my life, I had a month lying on a bed, seeing the sunlight coming from one window and dissappearing to the other window.
              It was one of the special experience I had. Since that time, I feel the miracle that light arrives to our life after
              travelling over 150 million km. This feeling is difficult to explain logicallly, but I feel some layered knowledge
              assumption that let me imagine this big nature.
