              <h5>Running events the organizers of <a href="http://hexagonux.com/tokyo" target="_blank">Hexagon UX Tokyo Chapter</a>, an international NPO focused on providing support and mentoring to womxn 
                  and nonbinary folks, we noticed that many designers often mentioned casually that they felt lost in their career path, not sure how 
                  to connect into the community or even unsure if they were actually a designer. We wondered if there might be a way for us to write 
                  these thoughts down for the community. Motivated to better understand the community we were serving, we started a research project 
                  to ask designers in Japan about their personal stories of resilience. We received responses from 36 professionals, who define 
                  themselves as designers, whom we reached through our personal networks and through cooperation with Startup Lady Japan and Tokyo 
                  Expat Network. <br />
                During this research, the coronavirus pandemic hit. Compared with the previous year, over half of our respondents said that their 
                resilience had been challenged more or significantly more. In the middle of these transitional moments, we continued this quest, 
                aiming to share unique stories of designers in Japan overcoming challenges with their personal, professional, and pandemic lives. 
                With this report, we hope to inspire designers in Japan to learn from others and share their own stories of resilience.
                <br/>For this research project, we used the following methods:</h5>

                  <li>SNS to reach research target</li>

              <h5><a href="https://simeji.me/" target="_blank">Simeji</a> is an IME
                that provides unique communication ways for the users.
                For example, it provides cloud based text predictions whereby the
                dictionary was updated over time based on user trends.
                It was initially developed for Android and had over 10 million users
                by 2014. In 2014, the newly introduced iOS 8 accepted 3rd party IME
                and so we developed and released the iOS app within 3 months.<br />
                To design the iOS app, keeping its original brand, I observed the difference between the platforms. 
                UI comparison was one of the essential understanding to design the product to appeal the market. 
                After the launch, I had an opportunity to present the learning at <a href="https://abc.android-group.jp/2014w/conference/design/" target="_blank">Japan Android Group</a>.
                And this learning became base knowledge to design other mobile apps in my career.

                  raw physical materials that have barely been manipulated. I understood them as 'pure record' of the time. 
                  In these woodblock printing, I tried to capture the scene about people around me at that time, although later 
                  I started to be aware of a lot of layers between 'artworks' and 'reality'.<br />
