          Currently, I work as a product manager at
          <a href="https://home.kpmg/jp/en/home/about/kit.html" target="_blank">KPMG Ignition Tokyo</a> and design the UX/UI of the product lineup.
          Besides work, I am an organizer of the NPO <a href="http://hexagonux.com/tokyo" target="_blank">Hexagon UX</a>, which supports women & non-binary folks in UX.
          Previously I worked at <a href="https://www.baidu.com/" target="_blank">Baidu</a>,
          where I designed IME to help over 18 million users enjoy communicating more uniquely.
          <br /><br />
          I care products that are simple, yet well thought for a lasting experience. When I work on projects,

            <p>
              Simeji is an IME that provides unique communication ways for the users.
              For example, it provides cloud based text predictions whereby the
              dictionary was updated over time based on user trends.
              It was initially developed for Android and had over 10 million users
              by 2014. In 2014, the newly introduced iOS 8 accepted 3rd party IME
              and so we developed and released the iOS app within 3 months.<br/>
              Accordingly the design challenge at the iOS app launch was not only to design the UI with 
              its core value proposition for the new market, but also to encourage the team to meet 
              the target launch day that had been announced worldwide.

              Looking the rising trend of machine lerning, I was not sure how designer's role would change. 
              After taking Machine learning at coursera with curiosity to this technology, I started this project about font geometry.

            <p>Imagination to me is exploring the possibility based on certain assumption or hypothesis of which 
              whether we are aware or not.<br/>
              Working with people who have over 10 different nationalities, I noticed sometimes people say something 
              offensive to another without knowing they could say the same things in a nicer way. Reading books about this 
              topic, including The Culture Map by  Erin Meyer, I started to assume that advising 
              on language would help people.  To explore this assumption and how technology can help, I developed this app 
              to help users become aware of their language, It suggests alternative ways to say for the 
              user who tests words that they are about to say.

              As one of the organizers of Hexagon UX, a NPO that typically hosts events to support UX folks, we started a reserach about resilience. 
              We started this research after hosting events in Tokyo for a year and a half and noticed 
              that many designers often mentioned casually that they felt lost in their career path,
                not sure how to connect with the community or even unsure if they were actually a designer. We wondered if there might be a way for us 
                to write these thoughts down for the community.
